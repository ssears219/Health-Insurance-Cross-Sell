# Health-Insurance-Cross-Sell-Prediction

In this project, I will simulate a data science project in which an insurance company is attempting to identify current health insurance customers who would be interested in vehicle insurance. I will analyze past data of customers who were recipients of a cross-sell in order to inform the business on the customer segments with the most opportunity. Furthermore, I will develop a model that will predict whether or not the customer would be interested in vehicle insurance depending on the variables that would be known prior to solicitation.
